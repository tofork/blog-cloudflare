继续对自己进行心理分析。

手头的事情千头万绪，还被不同的领导催，下面还有师弟的工作我要顾着，又要顾着大的，还得管着小的。给自己有很大的心理压力。一天净被无数的琐事干扰了。于是心里十分烦闷。是不是工作之后也是这样子呢？时间都被无聊的事情占据了。

本来今天安排的是另一件事情，对方鸽了没有来；明天也有另一件事情，另一个对方同样鸽了没有来。并且这两件事情的完成时间最多到明天。此后要是想再来做，难度会增加。为什么会觉得心情低落呢？因为my plan is alway DISTURBED. 感到工作已经失去了控制，脱离了昨晚安排好的一切计划。计划被打乱总是会让我心情郁闷，一旦lose control就会不知道事情要花费多少精力才能达到预定的结果。这种“判断”给人的感觉很不好。

宽慰自己：一切事情都是自己的想象，船到桥头自然直，不去想象还没有发生的事情好了。所以解决办法就是：安安静静地写论文，把能写的部分写了再说好了！

> I just completed my paper task today, so I'm trying to write a diary in English.

The psychoanalysis of myself continues.

The task I have to do is complicated. Different SUPERVISORS push me throughout the day without providing any effiecient help. I have to take care of not only the younger student's work but also the SUPERVIOSRS' work. All of these responsibilities cause me considerable stress.

My energy is diverted by countless trivialities. Will my future work be like this, filled with trivialities, preventing me from conducting meaningful research or engaging in other activities?

Today, I had a meeting scheduled, but the person I was to meet didn't show up due to their own matters. Tomorrow, I have another meeting scheduled, and the person I will meet isn't attending again for their own reasons. NOTICE: These issues, both today's and tomorrow's, will become even harder to resolve if we don't address them by Friday.

So, the reason why I feel upset is that my plan is always DISTURBED. My work plan, which I perfectly arranged last night, is out of control. I don't know how much energy I'll need to correct everything and get it back on track. I must say, clarify that these are all "judgements" rather than "facts". The imagined scenarios have not happened yet. It is just the imagination of the future that makes me feel not good. 

RELAX! Everything is in my imagination. We'll deal with it when it comes. It is better for my fragile mental state not to imagine things that have not happened. WRITE MY PAPER with love and peace!
